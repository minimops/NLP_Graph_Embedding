# Introduction

## Motivation

## Applications

  - uses in social networks
  - visualization
  - Network compression
  - Network Partitioning
  - Node Classification
  - Link Prediction
  - fake news detection 

  
perhaps omit some examples as to not overcrowd or overcomplicate this passage.

## Graph types

  - What is a Graph? 
  - Nodes and edges
  - Nodes are the entities
  - Edges are the relations between nodes
  - nodes can consist of all sort of Data, images, text, etc even mixed
  - nodes can have additional attributes
  
### Graph modes

  - homogeneous, heterogeneous
  - graphs can be directional, weighted, semantik, knowledge based
  
  
## Embedding types
  
  - node embedding
  - edge embedding
  - subgraph/Groups
  - entire Graphs


# Problem and Dataset

  introduce the Problem and the associated Dataset on which the algorithms below should be run on.


# Deep Learning and random Walk

  Short Paragraph explaining how one Approach to (node)Graph embedding utilizes Deep Learning methods. List the other approaches not using DL with a brief explanation, and especially mention how the computational advantage of the Random Walk approach can be preferable to MF.
  
## Random Walk

  Introduce the random Walk concept as another subsection of Deep Learning tools for Graph embedding. 
  What is the Aim of the Random Walks?

## SkipGram

  Briefly explain the NLM SkipGram and how its paired with Random Walks.
  Also introduce the problem of calculating the associated softmax equation.

### DeepWalk as an example for Hierarchical softmax

### node2vec as an example for negative sampling

## (LSTM)

  Optional Section considered as an excursion to another Random Walk method using a different Model and heterogeneous Graphs as Inputs. Perhaps using HSNL as the algorithm example.



# Performance Evaluation

  Discuss how to evaluate Graph Embedding methods and algorithms and then evaluate the above used ones.
